    <string name="roast_pork_loin_stuffed_with_andouille_and_crawfish_directions">For stuffing: In a 3-quart saucepan, cook sausage in hot oil for 2 minutes. Add crawfish, the sliced onion, and the thinly sliced celery; cook until onion is tender. Remove from heat; add bread. Stir in enough of the water to moisten. Set aside. Preheat oven to 325 degree F. Trim excess fat from pork roast. Butterfly the meat by making a lengthwise cut down center of meat, cutting to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Spread open. Place a knife in the "V" of the first cut. Cut horizontally to the cut surface and away from the first cut to within 1/2 inch of the other side of the meat. Repeat on opposite side of "V". Spread these sections open. Place pork open on a cutting board; cover with plastic wrap. Starting from the center, gently pound pork evenly until 1/2 inch thick (about a 15x9-inch rectangle). Spoon stuffing in an even layer onto pork, leaving a 1-inch space on each long side. Starting from one of the long sides, roll pork into a spiral. Using 100 percent cotton string, tie the pork loin at even intervals until the whole pork loin is evenly shaped and tied. Sprinkle with pepper. In a large roasting pan, combine onion wedges, carrot, and the sliced 2 stalks celery; place a rack over the vegetables. Place roast on top of rack (tuck vegetables under the roast). Insert an oven-going meat thermometer into center of roast. Roast for 2 to 2-1/2 hours or until thermometer registers 155 degree F. Remove roast and vegetables from roasting pan, reserving drippings. Cover roast and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. The temperature of the roast after standing should be 160 degree F. Meanwhile, for sauce: Stir bourbon into reserved drippings in roasting pan, scraping to loosen browned bits. Transfer mixture to a medium saucepan. Stir in tomato paste and garlic. Bring to boiling; boil gently for 3 to 4 minutes or until mixture is thickened, stirring constantly. Stir in chicken broth, thyme, and rosemary. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Remove and discard thyme and rosemary sprigs. Cool slightly. Pour broth mixture into a food processor; cover and process until nearly smooth. To serve, cut meat into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick slices. Serve meat and vegetables with sauce. Makes 12 servings. </string>

    <string name="pepper_pork_tamales_directions">For filling:In a 4-quart Dutch oven, combine pork, onion quarters, sliced garlic, and cracked black pepper. Add enough water to cover (about 4 cups). Bring to boiling; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 1 to 1-1/4 hours or until meat is very tender. Remove meat from broth. Let meat and broth cool slightly. Remove and discard any fat from pork; shred pork. Strain broth and reserve 2-1/2 cups broth for the dough (save remaining broth for another use). Cover and chill meat and broth separately until ready to use. Meanwhile, in a dry medium skillet, cook ancho and New Mexico peppers over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes or until they have a toasted aroma, turning frequently. Let cool. Wearing disposable plastic gloves or small plastic bags, remove and discard pepper stems, seeds, and ribs. Tear peppers into pieces and place in a bowl. Cover peppers with boiling water; let stand for 30 to 60 minutes to soften. Meanwhile, soak corn husks in hot water about 30 minutes or until soft. Place a fine sieve over a bowl; pour softened peppers into sieve. Drain well; reserve peppers and liquid. In a blender, combine the soaked peppers, the 1 clove garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the cumin seeds. Add 1/2 cup of the pepper soaking liquid; cover and blend until nearly smooth. Transfer blended pepper mixture to a medium saucepan. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, about 10 minutes or until reduced to 1/2 cup. Stir shredded pork into hot pepper mixture in saucepan. For dough: In a large bowl, stir together Masa Harina, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add cooking oil; beat with an electric mixer or a spoon until combined. Stir in enough of the strained pork broth to make a mixture that resembles a thick creamy paste. To prevent dough from drying out, cover with a damp paper towel while assembling tamales. To assemble each tamale, drain a corn husk well; pat dry with paper towels. Starting about 1 inch from the top edge of the husk, spread about 2 tablespoons of the dough into a rectangle 3 inches wide and 4 inches long, spreading so one of the long sides is at the long edge of the husk. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the pork filling down the center. Fold the long edge of each husk over the filling so it overlaps dough slightly. Wrap husk around outside of filled dough. Tie ends with strips of corn husk or heavy kitchen string. To steam tamales, in a very large Dutch oven, stand half of the tamales upright in a steamer basket. (Dont pack them in too tightly, but fill all the spaces.) Place at least 1-1/2 inches of water in the bottom. Bring to boiling. Cover Dutch oven. Reduce heat to medium. Steam for 30 to 35 minutes or until tamales easily pull away from corn husks and dough is spongy. Makes 26 to 28 tamales.</string>
    <string name="pepper_pork_tamales_tip">Prepare tamales as directed. Cool slightly. Wrap tamales in plastic wrap. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat refrigerated or frozen tamales, steam them as directed above, allowing 8 to 10 minutes for refrigerated tamales or about 15 minutes for frozen tamales or until heated through. Tamales can also be reheated in the microwave still wrapped in the husks. Cook each refrigerated tamale on 100 percent power (high) about 1 minute or until heated through.

    <string name="citrus_sweet_potato_pie_directions">Preheat oven to 450 degree F. Prepare Oil Pastry. On a well-floured surface, use your hands to slightly flatten dough. Roll dough from center to edge into a circle about 11 inches in diameter. To transfer pastry, wrap it around the rolling pin. Unroll pastry into 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom or a 9-inch pie plate. Ease pastry into pan without stretching it. Press pastry into fluted sides of tart pan and trim edges. (Or, if using a pie plate, crimp edge as desired.) Line pastry with a double thickness of foil. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove foil. Bake for 5 minutes more. Cool on a wire rack while preparing filling. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degree F. For filling: In a large bowl, stir together mashed sweet potatoes, sugar, vanilla, lemon peel, lemon juice, and the 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Add egg. Beat lightly with a fork just until combined. Gradually add evaporated milk; stir until combined. Pour filling into baked pastry shell. To prevent overbrowning, cover edge of pie with foil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean and edges are puffed. If necessary to allow pastry to brown, remove foil for the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking. Cool on a wire rack. Cover and refrigerate within 2 hours. To serve, remove tart from pan or leave pie in pie plate. Cut tart or pie into wedges. If desired, top each serving with a dollop of dessert topping and sprinkle with additional nutmeg. Makes 12 servings. Baked Oil Pastry: In a medium bowl, stir together flour and salt. Add cooking oil and milk all at once to flour mixture. Stir lightly with a fork. Form into a ball. </string>
